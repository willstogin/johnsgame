// 2: Danger! Someone in your group realized that they broke their arm during
//      the crash. If no one in the group has a first-aid kit, that person must
//      rest for two hours. The first-aid kit can still be used afterward.
// 3: You found a large first-aid kit. Use it once to give one health to every
//      one in your group.
// 4: Your group found a pack of small flares! Each person can only cary one flare.
//      Flares can be used to notify everyone in the zone where you are. Then
//      anyone in the zone can take a two-hour trek to get to that location.
// 5: Danger! A storm is coming. If any player is not sheltered in two hours,
//      then they lose 2 health. If they do take shelter, they lose that turn.
// 6: Landmark-Zone B: Entrance to the woods. There is a bridge to the entrance. For
//      each person in the group, there are 1:6 odds that they get hurt crossing
//      the bridge and lose 2 health. In that case, everyone else loses 1 health
//      trying to help.
// 7: Landmark-Shelter: Crash Site. You can replenish your health and water. You
//      can also find shelter at this site.
// 8: Landmark: A clearing. There is nothing here.
// 9: Danger! BEAR ATTACK! Everyone can immediately decide to split into groups.
//      The largest remaining group gets chased by a bear. For a group of size
//      n, odds are 1:n+1 that nobody gets hurt.
// 10: Landmark-Zone C: Foot of the mountain. Decide if you want to enter Zone C
// 11: You salvage some airplane parts to build a travel tent. Each person can
//      only cary one part and you must have to parts to make a shelter.
